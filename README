Move the vim folder to your $HOME directory or another location. Then create a symbolic link from the vim/vimrc to $HOME/.vimrc. If you already have a $HOME/.vimrc file just merge the contents of the old .vimrc file to the vim/vimrc file and then replace $HOME/.vimrc with the symbolic link..

If you have questions message me over github.
